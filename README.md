# AI_Project_sudoku
AI project 5th sem

Just basic template for generating and solving a board. 
This uses the backtracking algorithm.
gen_new just replaces the digits in the pre existing sample_board.
We can change the sample_board to any value. 
solve() solves it (obviously)

Also we push everything to test...
